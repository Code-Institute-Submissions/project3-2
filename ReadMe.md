Appreadbook
Book Manager(appreadbook)is a task list app - Stream 3 Project

This is a task manager app, for the users where they can manage their book library and activities and information about the tasks they created. 

User Experience
This app is intended for users  to manage their home library and the books their taking. By adding a chosing a category, the user know from which library he has taken the book.By choosing the right activity the user know what should do with the book. User can chose the genre of the book,wtite the author and add a date depends on the activity, just as remainder to bought the book at that date to,retur it or to lend it(to what was date he has kend it).
At the bottom at new book task(addtask.html) i have put in two  slide buttons if the book is read or still not and if it is urgent to be returned. Nice feature is if you chose that you have bought the book it is urgent to returned disappear becasue their is no need the book to be returned(you have boughted the book an it is yours). 
when you have created a book task it goes to the home page(tasks.html). From there you can add a new task from the navbar or the button at the bottom ,delete a task that user have greated or edit it. If the book is read or returned or the task is finishe ,the user  can delete it as well.
In the book categories there are four main categories but if it is needed the user still can create their own category if they have taken the book from a place that is not listed as a category or just to ring a bell for a special one(place).App has got also delete function for the categories if the user want to personalize the categories and create their own.

Template from the Lms videos was used to build this app. There were some specific UX designs that were taken into consideration when styling this site. The navbar was on the top off the desktop view to present a cleaner, more minimalistic approach to the design,and every page has a background photo which the same one for more minimalistic design. 

When you click to see the details about a  task, you'll be able to also see all of the options that the user has filled in from the add task form and to have all of the information  that is needed.

Development Process
The  databbase was done first, then the back end (appred.py) with the styling added after. As the styling was progressing, and after it was mostly finished, there were some back-end additions that needed to be made.

Manual Testing:
Manual testing was done for all edit/add/delete/ functions in appreadbook app. This was to ensure that what was supposed to be deleting was deleting, and that users  were able to delete/edit the content selected or add a new one.r the posts and comments. All links are verified to be working correctly via manual testing.
